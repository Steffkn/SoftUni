-- Problem 16: Create SoftUni Database
--- Towns (Id, Name)
--- Addresses (Id, AddressText, TownId)
--- Departments (Id, Name)
--- Employees (Id, FirstName, MiddleName, LastName, JobTitle, DepartmentId, HireDate, Salary, AddressId)
--- Id columns are auto incremented starting from 1 and increased by 1 (1, 2, 3, 4â€¦). Make sure you use appropriate data types for each column. Add primary and foreign keys as constraints for each table. Use only SQL queries. Consider which fields are always required and which are optional.
